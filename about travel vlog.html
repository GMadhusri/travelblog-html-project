<p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif">Hi, I’m Nomadic Matt, the New York Times best-selling author of How to Travel the World on $50 a Day and Ten Years a Nomad, as well as the founder of this website! And I’m here to help you save money on your next trip.

    Have you ever said one of the following:
    
    “How do I find the money to travel? It seems too expensive for me.”
    “Where do I find the best travel deals?”
    “How do I save money on flights, accommodation, and other big expenses?”
    “How do I plan my trip?”
    “How do I stay safe and healthy?”
    “How do I maximize my time?”
    “I want to travel more, but I don’t know the first step.”
    
    You are not alone. </p>
